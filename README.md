# React Native IDE

## Welcome to React Native IDE Private Beta üéâ

React Native IDE is not a ready product (yet).
We are hoping that together with the community we will be able to get there soon.
We are thankful that you decided to join the beta program and help us improve this tool.

### ‚ú® What

React Native IDE is a vscode extension that aims to streamline development of React Native and Expo applications.
The current version supports developing for Android and iOS platforms with the current list of features available:

- Managing iOS and Android simulator (for now only iPhone Pro and Pixel 7 skins are available)
- Automatically build and launch your project (keeping track of native or javascript updates automatically)
- Integrated debugger always available ‚Äì when running the project you can set breakpoints in the editor and don't need to bother with any additional configuration to get your application stop at those breakpoints
- Element inspector that jumps to component code
- Integrated console log output panel that links to file/line with the log statement
- Preview package that allows for working on components in isolation (render single component instead of the whole app)
- Expo Router integration with browser-like URL toolbar
- Easy access to device settings for text size and light/dark mode
